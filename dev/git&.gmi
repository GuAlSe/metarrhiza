Git-related thoughts here so I don't lose them.

## Creating a hypha
* After creating the content files and maybe some directories, stage them and commit:
```
Created ‘page’

{"by": "someone"}
```

## Uploading a binary part
* If the file has to be renamed, git-move it. Stage, commit:
```
Uploaded a new binary part for ‘page’

{"by": "someone"}
```

## Upload a text part
* If thi file has to be renamed, git-move it. The thing is, all files are .gmi for now, so no need to worry about that.
* Stage, commit:
```
Edited ‘page’

{"by": "someone"}
```

## Renaming a hypha
* Git-move, stage, commit:
```
Renamed ‘page’ to ‘super page’

{"by": "someone"}
```
